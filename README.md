# Welcome to HoliStay, your ultimate destination for booking accommodations. Discover unique venues and manage your bookings effortlessly.

## Tech Stack

This site was built with React, Vite, and TypeScript. Tailwind CSS was used for styling, along with libraries such as React-Icons and Yup for validation and many others.

# Accommodation Booking Assignment

## Goal

Build an accommodation booking site using React, Vite, and TypeScript.

# Brief

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
